The majority of asteroids fall into the following three 
categories:

     C-type (carbonaceous):  Includes more than 75 percent 
of known asteroids. Very dark with an albedo of 0.03-0.09. 
Composition is thought to be similar to the Sun, depleted in 
hydrogen, helium, and other volatiles. C-type asteroids 
inhabit the main belt's outer regions.

     S-type (silicaceous):  Accounts for about 17 percent 
of known asteroids. Relatively bright with an albedo of 
0.10-0.22. Composition is metallic iron mixed with iron- and 
magnesium-silicates. S-type asteroids dominate the inner 
asteroid belt.

     M-type (metallic):  Includes many of the rest of the 
known asteroids. Relatively bright with an albedo of 0.10-
0.18. Composition is apparently dominated by metallic iron. 
M-type asteroids inhabit the main belt's middle region.
